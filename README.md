### Description
I generated this code during my month long intern induction program with Nimble Accounting. This took place the summer of 2022. (This is the summer before I entered  university.) The induction program familiarizes interns with web application development. **/Daily Lessons** refers to code used by the instructors to teach, and **/Projects** refers to code that was completely by me.

My coding skills steadily improved over the course of the program. Please refer to the later projects in the list to get the most up-to-date examples of my programming.
